# Improving Code Quality for Java Projects

## What is Code Quality & Why it matters?
1.Reliability:
  Should work consistently without frequent crashes.
2.Consistent Code Style:
  Should follow consistent code style and naming conventions applicable to the language
3.Maintainable: 
  Should be easy to understand. Maintainable code is easy to extend and add new functionality.
4.Well-tested: 
  Code that has well-written tests tends to have fewer bugs
5.Efficient:
  Should not use unnecessary resources to perform the desired operations
6.Secure:
  Should prevent coding vulnerabilities like SQL injection
7.Lower Technical Debt: 
  Having low technical debt allows teams to move fast and develop new functionality without being slowed down by low quality and non-maintainable code
