# Improving Code Quality for Java Projects

## What is Code Quality & Why it matters?
### Reliability:
  Should work consistently without frequent crashes.
### Consistent Code Style:
  Should follow consistent code style and naming conventions applicable to the language
### Maintainable: 
  Should be easy to understand. Maintainable code is easy to extend and add new functionality.
### Well-tested: 
  Code that has well-written tests tends to have fewer bugs
### Efficient:
  Should not use unnecessary resources to perform the desired operations
### Secure:
  Should prevent coding vulnerabilities like SQL injection
###Lower Technical Debt: 
  Having low technical debt allows teams to move fast and develop new functionality without being slowed down by low quality and non-maintainable code
